## Description of website:
- We are making a movie recommendations website that randomly generates a movie, along with information about it for the user. We will also have categories and a search bar, which will make finding movies easier. If a user likes a movie, they can save it and come back to it easily. Each movie has information attached to it. 
- If time permits, we will try to find nearby showings of a movie, or other ways of watching that movie. We will also try to implement a light/dark mode setting.
