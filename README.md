## Description of website:
- Originally, we intended to make a movie recommendations website that randomly generates a movie, along with information about it for the user. However, our project has expanded since then, and we will show information about specific movies as well as specific showings of it (if there are any). We will also display certain genres of movies.
- Movie showings was originally a reach goal, but we've implemented it.
